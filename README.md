# Euclifer: Non-Riemannian-Lattice-Gravity

A Spinor Field is placed on curved spacetime represented by a dynamical spherical triangulation.
Path Integral Monte-Carlo techniques are used to generate an ensemble of 2D manifolds and spin configurations. 
The theory is Non-Riemannian as it allows the manifold to have torsion.
